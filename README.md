A place to share the best Teaching/Learning resources for common core standards.

## Dev Notes

### goals

- <s>All grade levels for Math</s>
- <s>All grade levels for English</s>
  - fix columns for CCRA?
  - find some english resources

### todos
- <s>file upload/download</s>

- <s>parse std descriptions/titles</s>

- add http://www.openmiddle.com/ as source

- refactor
  - insertResources
    - using stdCodes func from desc-scraper

- accessibility

### Ideas
- fully automate stds scraping?
- does betterlesson have an API?
- actual search (by title / std.)
- batch upload?
- different way of selecting stds?
  - similar to commoncore site (pick grade, domain -> standard)
  - type like a search box
