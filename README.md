### todos
- <s>file upload/download</s>

- std code on comments page should link to that std page

- accessibility

### Ideas
- fully automate stds scraping?
  - in case stds get update
  - load xml from cc site
  - wrap w/ API?
- does betterlesson have an API?
- actual search (by title / std.)
- batch upload?
- different way of selecting stds?
  - similar to commoncore site (pick grade, domain -> standard)
  - type like a search box
