# Common Core Resource Share

[CCShare](https://ccshare.herokuapp.com/cc/)

A place to share the best Teaching/Learning resources for common core standards.

## Dev Notes

### goals

- <s>All grade levels for Math</s>
- <s>All grade levels for English</s>
  - fix columns for CCRA?
  - find some english resources

### todos
- <s>file upload/download</s>

- <s>parse std descriptions/titles</s>
  - change subject selection to be more like common core site
  - need to filter weird characters
  - show subject when no description

- accessibility

- refactor
  - insertResources
  - styles
  - i dont think i like having code in index files

### Ideas
- does betterlesson have an API?
- actual search (by title / std.)
- batch upload?
- different way of selecting stds?
  - similar to commoncore site (pick grade, domain -> standard)
  - type like a search box
